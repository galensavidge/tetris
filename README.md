# Python Tetris
I'm making Tetris from scratch in Python just for fun! Code is all by me with the exception of graphics.py.

## Setup
Install the keyboard module using the command:
```
$ pip install keyboard
```
Then run tetris.py to play the game.

## Controls
| Function		| Key		|
| ------------- | --------- |
| Left			| A			|
| Right			| D			|
| Soft drop		| S 		|
| Hard drop		| W			|
| Rotate CW		| K			|
| Rotate CCW	| J			|
| Hold piece	| L			|
| Quit			| Esc		|
